## âš¡ Fun fact:
I love poring over animal-related articles and exploring how robotics can draw inspiration from them.

## Projects
- **Multi-Robot Systems**: Developed robust algorithms for advanced swarm control, exploration techniques, and coordination protocols for UAVs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Created a navigation system for autonomous parking and crash avoidance in dual steering vehicles.
- **CNN-based 6DoF Pose Estimation**: Worked on an end-to-end CNN model for pose estimation using 3D radar images at ETH Zurich.
- **SLAM and Path Planning**: Implemented pose ICP-based SLAM using 2D LiDAR and enhanced vision-based navigation techniques.
